<h3>A Different Approach</h3>
<p>
After trying many PHP frameworks including CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Symphony, Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla and Magento I became interested in framework development and decided to make my own. Although I have taken much inspiration from the above mentioned frameworks Trounce has some new ideas in it too.

<h4>MVC with Layout XML</h4>
<p>Trounce makes use of Layout XML to give the developer more flexibility and save time. This feature was inspired by Magento's XML layout.
For example here is a layout home.xml that is to be rendered using the dark_blue theme. When an action is run in the default controller , the default.xml Layout file is loaded by convention. The relevant blocks will be automatically rendered if they exist for the current action. This is a very powerful workflow.</p>
